# Welcome to My Generative AI Projects Repository!
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m diving deep into the world of Generative AI, building tools and applications that push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible with large language models (LLMs). This repository is my workspace for exploring, experimenting, and delivering practical AI solutions.

# Whatâ€™s Inside?
Ummm... Let's See something good is awaited to write here.

# Tools and Technologies Iâ€™m Mastering
LLMs: Iâ€™m working with cutting-edge models like DeepSeek-V1/V3, LLaMA, Microsoft Phi, and other small language models (SLMs) to solve real-world problems.
</br>
Frameworks: Leveraging LangChain for building scalable AI pipelines and Hugging Face for model fine-tuning and deployment.
</br>
Continuous Learning: Iâ€™m constantly expanding my expertise in AI, NLP, and LLM-based application development to stay ahead of the curve.

# Whatâ€™s Next?
Iâ€™m focused on exploring advanced use cases like multi-modal AI, custom model fine-tuning, and end-to-end AI solutions.
