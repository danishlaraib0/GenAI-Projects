This projedct is a basic GENAI Application that i made. I have used Deepseek V3 as my llm model and used BERT 
embeddings to generate the embeddings of text which we are extracting and i am storing it in a database obviosly vector database. 
CassandraDB (AstraDB) is a no sql based database which we are using through datastax.  so we are extracting text from PDF using 
PyPDF2 and converting the text into small batches and genrating the embeddings and then storing it in the DB. Then we are 
querying the llm based on our given data in pdf and it will answer based on out PDF.
